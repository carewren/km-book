            <h2>The Background</h2>
            <h3>Airport concessions are big business.</h3>
            <p>Last year, 64.5 million passengers traveled through Denver International Airport (DEN). That number is expected to continue growing, and when you account for the airport‚Äôs 35k employees, the daily population of the airport is somewhere around 200,000. This translates to big opportunities for terminal concessions.</p>

            <h2>The Design Brief</h2>
            <h3>Design a loyalty program.</h3>
            <p>DEN was recently named Best Airport in the U.S. by the Wall Street Journal, based on passenger ratings for value, convenience, and reliability. There‚Äôs an opportunity to build on this customer experience while continuing to grow DEN‚Äôs concessions business.</p>
            <p>With this in mind, DEN wanted to explore a digital loyalty program that would boost traveler spending at DEN concessionaires. Taking into account existing constraints and business goals, the client requested that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rewards structure appeals to both travelers and concessionaires</li>
                <li>Technical integration is seamless across concessionaires despite private owner/operators and varying POS systems</li>
                <li>All concessionaires receive equal representation and exposure</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Target users are frequent, discerning travelers.</h3>
            <p>Our first task was to understand. We sifted through research provided by the client, conducted competitive research, and drafted two proto-personas:</p>

            <div class="section-break"></div>

            <p>Next, we interviewed travelers who fit these personas. We asked them questions about their airport habits (‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your pre-flight routine at the airport?‚Äù) and their values (‚ÄúWhat makes a rewards program worth it to you?‚Äù). After synthesizing the perspectives gathered in these conversations, along with the rest of our research, we prioritized three key insights:</p>
