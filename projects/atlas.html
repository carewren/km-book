                <h3>Always looking for the ‚Äúduct tape‚Äù around us.</h3>
                <p>As a UX design student, I keep track of inconvenient things that bug me‚Äîthe ‚Äúduct tape‚Äù in life‚Äîbecause (1) it trains me to see the world through the lens of human-centered design, and (2) it uncovers opportunities for innovation. That‚Äôs how this project began, as an item on the Bugs Me list.</p>

                <p>A friend traveling to Mexico City mentioned that she had found a Google spreadsheet with tips on the best taquerias and local gems, because none of the travel sites were ‚Äúlocal enough.‚Äù Together with two of my classmates, I decided to explore ways to help travelers find the insider knowledge they needed to make every trip feel like it was guided by a local.</p>

            <h2>The Research</h2>
            <h3>Travelers are on a quest for authentic and local.</h3>
            <p>After the initial ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment, when we saw how travelers were crowd-sourcing authentic recommendations in Google sheets, we needed to dig deeper into how travelers plan their adventures. We wanted to know, ‚ÄúHow do you decide where to go?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat makes or breaks a trip?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat does ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô mean?‚Äù</p>
            <p>To answer these questions and understand users better, we conducted secondary research (including travel media), interviews, and card sorts. Then, we synthesized our insights using personas, a mental model, and a UX collage. We ended up with 5 key insights:</p>

            <h4>1. Travelers think in terms of ‚Äúbucket lists.‚Äù</h4>

                <div class="three-up">"Every trip should be your best trip. We want to do things and eat things that are totally unique to a place."</div>
                <div class="three-up"><blockquote>‚ÄúI‚Äôm always chasing the best places to go climbing. I just got back from France.‚Äù</blockquote></div>
                <div class="three-up"><blockquote>‚ÄúI‚Äôm always thinking about where I want to go next‚Äîright now I‚Äôm thinking Cambodia and Laos.‚Äù</blockquote></div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>2. Locals‚Äô knowledge is highly valued.</h4>
                <p>During a series of card sorts, we wanted to understand where trip inspiration comes from and which recommendations are most trusted. We found that the most highly prized suggestions come from locals or trusted friends who have personal experience in a location.</p>

                <h2>The UX</h2>
                <h3>Turning insights into MVP features.</h3>
                <p>Based on our prioritized research insights, my team began a collaborative UX design process,        starting with rapid sketching and force ranking. This was a great way to start visualizing how to translate research into design and make sure we were aligned on the product‚Äôs core purpose.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="page-wrap">
            <p>We ended up with 3 key features:</p>

            <h4>Content strategy supports discovery.</h4>
            <p>The core experience of Atlas is the discovery of tailored, authentic recommendations. We ideated a content strategy that would cross-link bookable products (accommodations, activities, and restaurants) with editorial content to enable themed discovery.</p>
            <img class="text-width" src="../img/fpo_16x9.png" alt="content strategy diagram">
            <p>An onboarding quiz, in addition to cumulative user engagement patterns, feed into an algorithm that personalizes suggestions to match the user‚Äôs travel vibe.</p>
            <img class="text-width" src="../img/fpo_16x9.png" alt="product wireframes">

            <h4>The bucket list.</h4>
            <p>Our insights show how travelers start planning their trips months before they book anything, so we designed a way for users to keep track of their bucket list items inside Atlas. They can save product pages or editorial content by location or theme, then easily book inside the app and check things off their bucket list.</p>
